    "## 1. Problem Statement: \n",
    "CO2 Emission and Energy Consumption are one of the major factors affecting the environment. As a homeowner or a renter it is really hard to get an estimate of what an annual energy consumption of their home will be like. Also apart from that it would be good if the user will get any suggestions to reduce their annual energy consumption which will help to reduce the amount of bills they are paying. Also , in this time of climate change it is essential to know the CO2 Emission from your home/building which is a major contributing factor of the environemental issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will be the attempt to predict/estimate the annual energy(KW/H) and CO2 emission of a residential building using the models trained on real world dataset, which I hope will help the end users find it useful to get valuable insights of their own homes and how to improve their energy consumption"
